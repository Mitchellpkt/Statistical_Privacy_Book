Notes:
-  These transaction characteristics are visible on-chain, so anybody with a copy of the ledger can note the fingerprint string for every transaction.
-  At the current network version, all transactions generated by the core wallet should have fingerprint `F0 = ADFGIK`.
-  An `F0` fingerprint does not necessarily indicate use of core software (since other wallets should mimic `F0`). However the appearance of a non-`F0` signature __does__ indicate the use of non-core software.
-  `F0` changes during some network upgrades, and is thus a function of version/time/block height. 
-  It may be helpful to consider the difference fingerprint (`D`) which returns only characteristics where the transaction deviates from the core software during that era.
