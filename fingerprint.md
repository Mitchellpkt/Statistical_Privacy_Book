Notes:
-  These transaction characteristics are visible on-chain, so anybody with a copy of the ledger can note the fingerprint string for every transaction.
-  At the current network version, all transactions generated by the core wallet should have fingerprint `F0 = ADFHIK`.
-  An `F0` fingerprint does not necessarily indicate use of core software (since other wallets should mimic `F0`). However the appearance of a non-`F0` signature __does__ indicate the use of non-core software.
-  `F0` changes during some network upgrades, and is thus a function of version/time/block height. 
-  It may be helpful to consider the difference fingerprint (`D`) which returns only characteristics where the transaction deviates from the core software during that era.
-  Numeric values may be added after relevant Y/N, for example `ADFG3IK` indicating that the unlock time was 8 blocks. In 2020 common unlock times include 0 (core software), 1, 3, 4, and 12. Depending on the nature of your analysis it may make sense to keep the `ADFG3IK` transactions separate from the `ADFG12IK` transactions.
